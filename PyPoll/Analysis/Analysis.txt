In this PyBank analysis, we are evaluating the election_data.csv file. In assessing the file, we are able to depict the Total Votes, List of Candidates, Percentage of the Votes, Number of Votes per Candidate, and the Winner Candidate.
To find the Total Votes, we count the number of rows in the file while skipping the header. List of Candidate, Percentage and Vote Counts are calculated by creating a list of existing candidates, count the number of votes associated to the list, and the Percentage is calculated by the number of votes divided by the total votes. The winner is depicts by the candidate with the most votes
As results we have the following:
